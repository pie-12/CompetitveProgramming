# Competitive Programming Journey 🚀

## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Nguyen Tung Lam**!  
*(Handle: **[pie-12](https://codeforces.com/profile/pie-12)**)*

I started my journey into the world of **Competitive Programming** back in **11th Grade**. Since then, solving algorithmic problems has become my daily passion. This repository serves as my personal library, documenting my growth, solutions, and the algorithms I've mastered along the way.

## 🛠️ Tools & Stats
- **Language**: C++ (STL, C++17/20) - *My main weapon ⚔️*
- **Editors**: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text
- **Platforms**:
  - 🟢 [Codeforces: pie-12](https://codeforces.com/profile/pie-12)
  - ⚫ [AtCoder: pie12](https://atcoder.jp/users/pie12)
  - 🟡 [LQDOj: pie12](https://lqdoj.edu.vn/user/pie12)

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized to keep things clean and accessible:

### `00_Templates/`
Standard templates for quick start.
- `Template_Default.cpp`: Base template for most problems.
- `Template_FastIO.cpp`: Optimized I/O for heavy input problems.

### `01_Library/` 📚
My personal algorithm library (The "Spellbook").
- **Data_Structures**: Segment Tree, Fenwick, DSU...
- **Dynamic_Programming**: Knapsack, Digit DP, Bitmask...
- **Graph_Theory**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Flows...
- **Mathematics**: Number Theory, Combinatorics...
- **String**: KMP, Z-Algo, Hashing...

### `02_Practice/` ⚔️
Daily practice problems, organized primarily by **Platform**.
- **Codeforces/**: Standard rounds and `Gym/` specialized training.
- **AtCoder/**: Organized by `ABC/` and `ARC/`.
- **CSES/**: Categorized by **Topic** (DP, Graph, Sorting...) as per the standard problem set.
- **VNOI/**, **SPOJ/**, **HACKERRANK/**: Problems from various Online Judges.
- **Topic_Training/**: Targeted practice sessions (e.g., `Two_Pointers`).

### `03_Contests/` 🏆
Live contest submissions and virtual participation, organized by Arena.
- **Codeforces/**: CF Rounds, Div 2, Div 3, Edu Rounds.

- **ICPC/**: Regional and National contests.
- **Olympiads/**: OLP, HSG.
- **VKU_Internal/**: Internal contests at Vietnam-Korea University (VKU).

### `04_History/` 🕰️
- **LEGACY_BACKUP/**: Full archive of old training phases (Raw data, preserved for integrity).

### `05_Playground/` 🧪
Scratchpad for testing and debugging.
