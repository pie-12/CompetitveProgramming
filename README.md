# Competitive Programming Journey 🚀

Welcome to my repository dedicated to **competitive programming**, where I document my journey, progress, and practice solutions. 

## 🌟 About Me
My passion for competitive programming ignited during **11th grade in high school**, and since then, I have been continuously honing my problem-solving skills. This repository is a testament to my dedication and growth in the field.

I believe that **every problem is a puzzle waiting to be solved**, and through consistent practice and learning, we can become better problem solvers, one line of code at a time.

## 📂 Repository Contents
Here’s what you’ll find:
- **Solutions**: My solutions to problems from various online judges (Codeforces, LQDOj, AtCoder, etc.).
- **Practice Topics**: Categorized problems based on algorithms and data structures (e.g., Graphs, DP, Binary Search).
- **Competitions**: My submissions and strategies from contests I’ve participated in.
- **Resources**: Links and notes on useful tutorials, articles, and guides.

## 🎯 Goals
- To improve my skills in algorithmic thinking and efficient coding.
- To actively participate in online contests and achieve higher ratings.
- To contribute to and learn from the vibrant competitive programming community.

## 🛠️ Tools and Platforms
- **Languages**: C++
- **Editors**: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text
- **Platforms**:
  - [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/pie-12)
  - [LQDOj](https://lqdoj.edu.vn/user/pie12)
  - [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/users/pie12)

## 🌱 Ongoing Progress
I am currently focusing on:
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graph Algorithms**
- **Advanced Data Structures** (Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree)
- **Mathematics** (Combinatorics, Number Theory)

## 💡 Why This Repository?
This repository serves as:
1. A **log** of my learning journey and improvement.
2. A **reference** for others who may find the solutions and approaches helpful.
3. A source of **motivation** for myself to look back and see how far I’ve come.
