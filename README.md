# Competitive Programming Journey

## About Me

Hi, I'm **Nguyen Tung Lam**!  
*(Handle: **[pie-12](https://codeforces.com/profile/pie-12)**)*

I started my journey into the world of **Competitive Programming** back in **11th Grade**. Since then, solving algorithmic problems has become my daily passion. This repository serves as my personal library, documenting my growth, solutions, and the algorithms I've mastered along the way.

## Tools & Stats
- **Language**: C++ (STL, C++17/20) - My main weapon
- **Editors**: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text
- **Platforms**:
  - [Codeforces: pie-12](https://codeforces.com/profile/pie-12)
  - [AtCoder: pie12](https://atcoder.jp/users/pie12)
  - [LQDOj: pie12](https://lqdoj.edu.vn/user/pie12)

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to keep things clean and accessible:

### 00_Templates/
Standard templates for quick start.
- Template_Default.cpp: Base template for most problems.
- Template_FastIO.cpp: Optimized I/O for heavy input problems.

### 01_Library/
My personal algorithm library.
- Data_Structures: Segment Tree, Fenwick, DSU...
- Dynamic_Programming: Knapsack, Digit DP, Bitmask...
- Graph_Theory: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Flows...
- Mathematics: Number Theory, Combinatorics...
- String: KMP, Z-Algo, Hashing...

### 02_Practice/
Daily practice problems, organized primarily by Platform.
- Codeforces/: Standard rounds and Gym/ specialized training.
- AtCoder/: Organized by ABC/ and ARC/.
- CSES/: Categorized by Topic (DP, Graph, Sorting...) as per the standard problem set.
- VNOI/, SPOJ/, HACKERRANK/: Problems from various Online Judges.
- Topic_Training/: Targeted practice sessions (e.g., Two_Pointers).

### 03_Contests/
Live contest submissions and virtual participation, organized by Arena.
- Codeforces/: CF Rounds, Div 2, Div 3, Edu Rounds.
- AtCoder/: ABC, ARC.
- ICPC/: Regional and National contests.
- Olympiads/: OLP, HSG.
- VKU_Internal/: Internal contests at Vietnam-Korea University (VKU).

### 04_History/
- LEGACY_BACKUP/: Full archive of old training phases (Raw data, preserved for integrity).

### 05_Playground/
Scratchpad for testing and debugging.
